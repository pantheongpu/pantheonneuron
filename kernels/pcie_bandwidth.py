"""Host-to-device and device-to-host transfer over PCIe.

Score: **GB/s**, counted by the workload, as the registry declares. The
device's own DMA counters are device-side only and do not see a host
transfer, so unlike the HBM kernels there is no profiler figure to prefer
here -- wall-clock timing is the measurement, not a fallback.

The probes recorded this part's link as Gen4 x8 with a Gen5 x8 maximum, so
a healthy result is bounded by the negotiated link rather than by HBM. That
makes this the workload that notices a link that trained down: a card
running at half its lanes still passes every compute test and shows up
here.

Each direction is timed separately. A single bidirectional figure hides the
asymmetry, and the asymmetry is usually where the fault is -- reads back
from the device commonly run slower than writes to it, so averaging them
turns a one-sided regression into a smaller two-sided one.

**Both legs copy into a buffer allocated once, and that is load-bearing.**
The first hardware run (trn1.2xlarge, 2026-09-08) reported d2h at 1.0 GB/s
against h2d at 6.0 and the asymmetry guard fired. The legs were not
symmetric at the time: h2d reused one host tensor while d2h called
``.cpu()``, which allocates a fresh host destination on *every* pass. A
6x split between "reuse a buffer" and "allocate, fault in, and free 1 GiB
each pass" is what an allocator costs, not what a link costs.

That does not prove the link is healthy -- it proves the old number could
not have told us either way. Both directions now ``copy_`` into a
destination allocated before the clock starts, so what is left is transfer.
The 1.0 GB/s figure should not be cited; it is kept in the git history as
a methodology marker, not as a measurement.

STATUS: UNTESTED ON HARDWARE in this form. No NKI: this is torch tensor
movement, so it depends on the runtime rather than on a compiled kernel.
